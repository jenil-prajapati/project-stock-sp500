In this project, I have predicted the price of the S&P500 stock market index using the dataset from Yahoo Finance Package.

**Project Steps**

1. Download data using the yfinance package.
2. Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy.
3. Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy.
4. Improve the accuracy of the model.

# About

### **File Overview**
- StockMarketPredictionS&P.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code.
- sp500.csv: CSV File with large dataset spanning nearly a century to present.

### **Local Setup**

Tools Used:
* JupyterLab
* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
  - pandas
  - yfinance
  - scikit-learn

# Usage of model

Based on the notebook content, to get the prediction daily, you need to run the following steps:

1. **Load the Latest Data**: This step ensures that your data is up to date.
2. **Train the Model**: This step involves training the model on the latest data.
3. **Make Predictions**: This step generates the prediction for the next trading day.
